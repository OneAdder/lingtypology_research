\section{Abstract}
This work describes a Python tool for linguistic typlogy -- lingtypology. It allows to get data from multiple online datasets, such as Wals, Autotyp, Phoible and AfBo in unified fromat and draw. Also it allows to draw interactive linguistic maps.

In this paper, I show how such features are implemented and how to use the library. I also provide several small studies that demonstrate usage of my package.

\section{Introduction}
There are multiple linguistic tools for Python. Most of them concentrate on natural language processing (e.g. NLTK~\cite{NLTK}). There are also some libraries that are there to assist linguistic research.

A good example of such package is LingPy~\cite{LingPy}. It provides multiple calculation and visualisation algorithms for historical linguistics.

Another example of this kind of libraries is LingCorpora
